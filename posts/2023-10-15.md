# Creating culture around upfront automated dependency resolution

Upfront automated dependency resolution is the process of resolving package-level dependency upgrades in a planned manner that utilizes continuous integration workflows. It also involves a culture shift within development teams. This shift involves recognizing the importance of addressing dependency upgrades proactively and systematically, rather than reactively. It requires teams to set aside capacity to prioritize dependency management and stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities and threats.

A frequent task amongst development teams is to address software vulnerabilities in their applications. It is very common for this to be a reactive exercise. From the top-down, a generalized workflow looks a little something like this at most organizations:

- A vulnerability is created as a CVE 
- The security team or some other fitness function identifies the exploit's existence across the organization's architectural quantum
- A call to action is created for the development team of impacted quanta
- The development team resolves the vulnerability
  - The team may do this by bumping the impacted package to the latest version, replacing the impacted code with something else, or arguing with the security team that the vulnerability is benign.
- Some fitness function (or the security team) ensures the vulnerability has been resolved
- The remediated version of the impacted quanta is released to production

Depending on a team's working agreement with security, they may be unable to release until the vulnerability is remediated. Some organizations even go the extra mile, requiring teams to stay within the latest 1 or 2 versions of a package.  While the business and stakeholders may view these protocols as blockers to development, the ability to respond to vulnerabilities and threats in software has never been more important. Therefore, it is appropriate that a large amount of the team's bandwidth be devoted to resolving these issues as soon as they are raised. See [CVE-2017-5638](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-5638) (Apache Struts/Equifax), and [CVE-2021-4428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) (Log4J) for a few of the more infamous cases showing what happens when this is not the case.

The speed at which this resolution workflow occurs may not be sufficient for navigating our increasingly adverse digital environment. When writing this in 2023, [CVE.org reports](https://www.cve.org/About/Metrics) that around 21,000 vulnerabilities have been posted this year alone, and we can see a trend that for the past 8 years, this number has only increased. 

A more preventative and progressive approach is needed. SaaS and platform-based companies recognize this and have introduced tools to empower security and development teams to establish ownership over their dependencies. The effective use of these tools, however, becomes a cultural concern.

By allocating time for upfront automated dependency resolution, teams can establish a proactive mindset toward dependency resolution. They can prioritize addressing dependency upgrades as a regular part of their workflow, rather than treating it as an ad-hoc task that is only done when vulnerabilities are discovered.

This cultural shift enables teams to take ownership of their dependencies and empowers them to navigate the increasing number of vulnerabilities and dependencies in our digital environment more effectively and efficiently. It encourages a preventive and progressive approach to software development, reducing the need for reactive fixes and context switches while minimizing possible attack vectors.

## Case Study: Garbage Day

One chore that almost every household has is taking out the garbage. Once a week, you go through your house, put all the trash into one bag, place that bag outside on the street (unfortunately, my city doesn't have roll carts), and then return inside to wash your hands. This last step reveals something about the chore: it's a dirty job that nobody enjoys doing, but it is necessary to prevent our houses from being filled with trash. However, it is a relatively easy and quick task (with a worst-case scenario of *O(n)*, where n is the number of trash cans in your house), and anyone in the household can do it.

An upfront automated dependency resolution process should resemble Garbage Day:

1. It should be a quick and relatively painless task
2. Any engineer on the team should be capable of doing it
3. It should be consistent across different architectural quanta
4. It should occur on a regular cadence, known by everyone on the team
