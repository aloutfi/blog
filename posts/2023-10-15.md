# Automated Dependency Resolution (part 1)

Upfront automated dependency resolution is the process of resolving package-level dependency upgrades in a planned manner that utilizes continuous integration workflows. It also involves a culture shift within development teams. This shift involves recognizing the importance of addressing dependency upgrades proactively and systematically, rather than reactively. It requires teams to set aside capacity to prioritize dependency management and stay ahead of potential vulnerabilities and threats.

A frequent task amongst development teams is to address software vulnerabilities in their applications. It is very common for this to be a reactive exercise. From the top-down, a generalized workflow looks a little something like this at most organizations:

- **CVE Creation:** A vulnerability is identified and documented as a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
- **Identification:** The security team or another fitness function detects the presence of this vulnerability across the organization's software architecture.
- **Alert to Engineering:** The engineering team responsible for the affected components is issued a call to action.
- **Resolution:** The development team addresses the vulnerability. This could involve upgrading the impacted package to the latest version, replacing the affected code, or engaging in discussions with the security team to evaluate the risk.
- **Validation:** Some fitness function or the security team verifies that the vulnerability has been effectively resolved.
- **Release:** The remediated version of the affected components is released to production.

Depending on a team's working agreement with security, they may be unable to release until the vulnerability is remediated. Some organizations even go the extra mile, requiring teams to stay within a package's latest 1 or 2 versions.  While the business and stakeholders may view these protocols as blockers to development, the ability to respond to vulnerabilities and threats in software has never been more important. Therefore, it is appropriate that a large amount of the team's bandwidth be devoted to resolving these issues as soon as they are raised. See [CVE-2017-5638](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2017-5638) (Apache Struts/Equifax), and [CVE-2021-4428](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) (Log4J) for a few of the more infamous cases showing what happens when this is not the case.

The speed at which this resolution workflow occurs may not be sufficient for navigating our increasingly adverse digital environment. When writing this in 2023, [CVE.org reports](https://www.cve.org/About/Metrics) that around 21,000 vulnerabilities have been posted this year alone, and we can see a trend that this number has only increased for the past 8 years. 

A more preventative and progressive approach is needed. SaaS and platform-based companies recognize this and have introduced tools to empower security and development teams to establish ownership over their dependencies. The effective use of these tools, however, becomes a cultural concern.

By allocating time for upfront automated dependency resolution, teams can establish a proactive mindset toward dependency resolution. They can prioritize addressing dependency upgrades as a regular part of their workflow, rather than treating it as an ad-hoc task only done when vulnerabilities are discovered.

This cultural shift enables teams to take ownership of their dependencies. It empowers them to navigate the increasing number of vulnerabilities and dependencies in our digital environment more effectively and efficiently. It encourages a preventive and progressive approach to software development, reducing the need for reactive fixes and context switches while minimizing possible attack vectors.

## Case Study: Garbage Day

One chore that almost every household has is taking out the garbage. Once a week, you go through your house, put all the trash into one bag, place that bag outside on the street (unfortunately, my city doesn't have roll carts), and then return inside to wash your hands. This last step reveals something about the chore: it's a dirty job that nobody enjoys doing, but it is necessary to prevent our houses from being filled with trash. However, it is a relatively easy and quick task (with a worst-case scenario of *O(n)*, where n is the number of trash cans in your house), and anyone in the household can do it.

An upfront automated dependency resolution process should resemble Garbage Day:

1. **Quick and Painless:** Garbage Day is relatively quick and straightforward, similar to triggering a developer experience-oriented automation. It should not be overly burdensome or disruptive to the development process.
2. **Any Team Member's Task:** Just as anyone in a household can take out the trash, any engineer on the development team should be capable of performing upfront automated dependency resolution.
3. **Consistency Across Quanta:** Garbage Day is a consistent, routine activity for maintaining cleanliness. Similarly, dependency resolution should be consistent across different architectural components of your software. 
   - Just as garbage isn't collected on holidays, developers shouldn't be expected to act during off hours to resolve a vulnerability. A standardized and dependable approach to dependency management ensures that the development process remains smooth and predictable, even in exceptional circumstances.
4. **Regular Cadence:** Garbage Day occurs on a regular cadence, known by everyone in the household. Likewise, upfront automated dependency resolution should follow a predefined schedule known to the entire development team.

Part 2 of this post will explore implementing a Garbage Day methodology that resolves these behavioral and functional requirements via [grouped Dependabot package upgrades in GitHub.](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#groups)

In conclusion, creating a culture of upfront automated dependency resolution is essential for modern software development. It not only streamlines the management of software dependencies but also reinforces a proactive mindset crucial in today's fast-paced and increasingly vulnerable digital landscape. By adopting this approach, teams can stay ahead of potential issues, minimize security risks, and ultimately deliver more secure and reliable software products.
